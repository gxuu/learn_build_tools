for main project, use

conan install . -b=missing

one can set options(whether a dependency is imported as shared, or settings such as whether to build debug)
e.g.:
conan install . -b=missing -o=normal/1.0:shared=True -o=zlib/1.3:shared=True -s=build_type=Debug

ffmpeg is just hard to build - I can't fix build errors
